Project Summary

Our lab frequently uses qPCR to analyze changes in gene expression in various cell lines and treatments. 
Our raw data are Ct values (Cycle threshold: number of cycles it takes for the signal to cross the background threshold) in a .csv file that we analyze, manipulate, and graph through Excel. 
This process is tedious and time-consuming, so we chose to tackle it for our final project.

Raw data: csv file titled "p150KO_p150_dcat_2.csv"

Our code is documented in detail within the script, but we have included a general outline here:
1.	Extract columns in Python
  a.	Remove header
  b.	Extract columns: C (well), D (Sample), F (Task), G (Ct values)
  c.	Create new, simplified csv file with cleaner data
2.	Analyze data in R
  a.	Import simplified csv file
  b.	Reorganize and clean data
  c.	Import and analyze reference gene (tubulin) Ct: average replicates
  d.	Import and analyze gene of interest (GOI)
    i.	Calculate dCt (change in GOI Ct from average tubulin Ct)
    ii.	Calculate dCt average of replicates
    iii.	Identify dCt average of control cell line (as in 2.d.i.)
    iv.	Calculate ddCt (change in dCt from average dCt of control)
    v.	Calculate fold change (2^(-ddCt)
    vi.	Calculate average and standard deviation of fold change values
3.	Graph processed data in R
  a.	Graph average and standard deviation of fold change values
  b.	Set title and axes 
4.	Repeat steps 2 and 3 with remaining GOIs


We have added Edit Points throughout the script for other members of the lab to identify and change to fit their sample names.

Edit point 1: Set working directory--Session->Set Working Directory->Choose Directory->choose file location
Edit point 2: Change filename =
Edit point 3: Designate individual gene names
Edit point 4: Make new data frame as GOI_data
Edit point 5: Make new data frame of analyzed GOI_data
Edit point 6: Check average and standard deviation 
Edit point 7: Change data frame and title for graph
