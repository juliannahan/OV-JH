#Open in qPCR
#remove header
#extract columns C, D, F, G from rows 29 to 110
#make new csv file with cleaner data
#seperate by genes and technical duplications(Tub 1, Tub2, etc)
#average each of tub
#dCT = Normalizing genes to Tublin
#take each techinical replicate for each gene and average to tublin CT (IFN 1 Bio Rep 1 Tec Rep 1 - Avg Tub 1 for each sample) (should have dCT1 and dCT2)
#Average control dCT for control sample(lenti)
#ddCT = take normalized gene measurement and substract normalized control. Repeat for all biological and technical replicates
#determine fold change relative to control 
#calculate average fold change for each sample of each gene
#calculate standard deviation
#calculate pvalue
#graph data in bar graph
